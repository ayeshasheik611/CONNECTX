# CONNECTX
This repository contains the implementation of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent for the Connect X competition on Kaggle. The project focuses on designing, training, and evaluating a smart agent capable of playing the Connect X game at a competitive level using RL techniques.
Connect X is a simulation competition by Kaggle. Build an RL (Reinforcement Learning) agent to compete against other Kaggle competition participants. 

You will first learn how the game works and create a dummy functional agent for a baseline. After that, you will start experimenting with various RL algorithms and model architectures. You can try building a model on Deep Q-learning
Key Features:

Custom Environment: A custom environment built using Kaggle's Connect X API, enabling seamless interaction with the game.
Agent Design: Implementation of various RL algorithms such as Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), or Actor-Critic methods for strategic gameplay.
State Representation: Efficient encoding of game states for better decision-making.
Training Pipeline: A scalable training pipeline for model improvement and testing against baseline agents.
Evaluation: Performance metrics and comparisons against other agents in simulated matches.
Visualization: Tools to visualize gameplay and analyze the agentâ€™s decision-making process.
This project demonstrates the power of reinforcement learning in board games and serves as a resource for those looking to build and optimize RL agents.

Feel free to contribute by adding enhancements, fixing bugs, or improving performance.
